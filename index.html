            <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>
            <h4>1856-1943</h4>
            <h3>Best known for his contributions to the design of
                the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply
                system.</h3>

            <p style="text-align: center;"> Nikola Tesla was a scientist whose inventions include
                the Tesla coil, alternating-current (AC) electricity,
                and the discovery of the rotating magnetic field.Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and
                market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical
                discharge
                tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever
                exhibited.
                Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements

                Nikola Tesla symbolizes a unifying force and inspiration for all nations in the name of peace and
                science.
                He was a true visionary far ahead of his contemporaries in the field of scientific development. New York
                State and many other states in the USA proclaimed July 10, Tesla’s birthday- Nikola Tesla Day.</p>
            <p>
                Nikola Tesla had a fascinating childhood. The son of a Serbian Orthodox Priest and a mother, who came
                from a
                long line of inventors, he was able to spend much of his childhood inventing and trying new things.
                During a
                long, cold and dry spell, he ‘discovered’ static electricity. He thought of this often and it profoundly
                influenced his adult life and his inventions. As a child he invented a cornstalk popgun, which contained
                the
                principles he adapted when he devised particle-beam weapons. And, after seeing a picture of Niagara
                Falls,
                young Nikola (he was somewhere between 10- and 14-years-of-age) told his Uncle Josip that one day he
                would
                place a gigantic wheel under the waterfall and harness it. In 1895, he and George Westinghouse built the
                first hydro-electric power plant in Niagara Falls.

            <p> His older brother died after a fall from a horse and thereafter Nikola began having “out-of body”
                experiences. In fact, those experiences were so real he sometimes needed his sisters to help him tell
                which
                were real and which were hallucinations. Those experiences continued throughout his life and actually
                were
                an asset to his creativity. He could visualize his finished inventions and modify them in his mind
                before
                committing them to paper. To learn more about the life of this fascinating and influential man, check

                Nikola began his career as an electrical engineer in 1881 while working with a a telephone company
                located
                in Budapest. It was there that the solution to the rotating magnetic field flashed through his mind,
                which
                led to the creation of the induction motor. In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work with
                Thomas
                Edison. He and Edison disagreed on direct current versus alternating current. Edison promoted the direct
                current, while Tesla believed the alternating current was more efficient. Tesla won that disagreement…
                He was a pioneer in many fields – in 1896 the Electrical Review published X-rays of a man which had been
                taken by Tesla. Others were also experimenting with X-rays at the same time but Tesla didn’t claim
                priority.
                It is reported that he said, “I don’t care that they stole my idea… I care that they don’t have any of
                their
                own.”

                Interestingly, in 1901 Tesla imagined a means of instant communication – he imagined receiving
                telegrams,
                stock quotes, etc., assigning them each a different frequency, which would then be broadcast to a device
                held in your hand. He essentially envisioned the internet and smart phones…
                220px-TeslacoilHe is perhaps most well-known for the Tesla Coil, which he developed in 1891. The Tesla
                Coil
                transforms energy into extremely high-voltage charges, which create powerful electrical fields capable
                of
                producing electrical arcs. A Tesla Coil is made of two parts – a primary coil and a secondary coil. Each
                has
                its own capacitor (which stores electrical energy like a battery does). The whole system is powered by a
                transformer. The two circuits are connected by a spark gap. The Tesla Coil revolutionized the way
                electricity was understood. Variations of the Tesla Coil are still used in radios and televisions.
